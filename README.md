# To Do List
A simple to-do-list app that I built for myself to use and as an experiment.

# Running the Application
If for some reason you want to run this app, there are two approaches to running the application: either installing it or running the standalone executable.

In both cases, you'll want to go to the [releases](https://github.com/vonderborch/To-Do-List/releases) page to find the latest released version to install/run.

## Installation
1. Download the `installer.zip` file
2. Extract the `installer.zip` file to somewhere
3. Run the `setup.exe` file in the extracted directory
4. Run the application!
5. ???
6. Profit?

## Standalone Executable
1. Download the `standalone.zip` file
2. Extract the `standalone.zip` file to somewhere
3. Run the `ToDoList.exe` file in the extracted directory
4. ???
5. Profit?

# Future Plans
Fix bugs if I find any and add features as I discover a need to
